description:
-----------
This folder contains several libraries that are not specific to the project Okteta
and could be reused elsewhere. They only depend on the Qt and KDE libraries, if
at all.

Some are static libraries and some are dynamic libraries.

libframesprint: a library for simple layouting of things to print

Kasten: a framework for creating programs and plugins
