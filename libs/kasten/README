-----------
libkasten is another approach to a model-view-controller oriented system
for (set of) programs operating on "desktop" objects.

It's a work in progress, there are a lot of undocumented temporary solutions
to have the basic system work at all. Do not try to guess the planned architecture
by the existing classes and their methods. There are a lot of unsketched ideas which
will be tried and developed by the time.

For other, currently more advanced (in code ;) systems look for
Sublime in kdevplatform, Kate's doc/view system, or the one used by Calligra.
Once libkasten is in a state where discussions make sense I will let the world
know.
