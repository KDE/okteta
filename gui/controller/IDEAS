Keyboard-Controller is simpler than the Mouse-Controller:
The KController::handleKeyPress(keyEvent) is a stateless method which passes
the input event in a priority chain of controllers until one accepts it.
The controller may only depend on the state of the view, but not on previous input.
(This may change in the future with VI-like control)

Mouse-Controller is different, as it is usually a series of inputs which defines
a command. And several commands may share part of the start sequence.

Which complicates things as there may be reactions already on the first input, like
a UI-button state change (down) on the press-down of a mouse button. So should
only those share the start which share the reaction, or should the first dominate the reaction?
What about extending with a new controller? Can the same start be solved by shared base-classes?

Also in the case of an unknown input sequence the latest input has to be restated
as the first in a next row.

So the algorithm might be:

Reset all controllers to active

For input
  if all active
    try is two
  end if
  for try of two
    for all active controllers
      pass input
      if controller done
        set input taken
        reset all controllers
        break
      else if controller rejected
        set controller inactive
      else // if controller 
        set input taken
    end for
    if input not taken
      if try is first
        reset all controllers
      else
        break
    end if
  end try
end for

Example:
LMB Click to set cursor
LMB click to set selection
LMB Click to mark word - starts by doubleclickpress
LMB Click to mark words by moving the cursor - starts also by doubleclickpress
LMB Click to drag
