description:
-----------
The lib implements a general usable widget named "KByteArrayView".
It interacts with the abstract byte array interface called "KAbstractByteArray"
as offered by the Okteta core library.


installing:
-----------
As the widgets are still in active development the API is not yet finished.
Because of that no headers are installed.
