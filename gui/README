description:
-----------
The lib implements two general usable widgets named "ByteArrayColumnView" and
"ByteArrayRowView". They interact with the abstract byte array interface
called "AbstractByteArrayModel" as offered by the Okteta core library.


installing:
-----------
As the widgets are still in active development the API is not yet finished.
Because of that no headers are installed.
