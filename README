Overview
--------
This directory holds the files of the Okteta project. This project is about
viewing and editing of data on the byte level.

It is divided in three parts:
* basic Okteta libraries
* Okteta elements for Kasten
* End-user products

The basic Okteta libraries, liboktetacore and liboktetagui, contain the classic
simple Qt/KDE widgets/classes others want to reuse in their code by linking to
these libraries. Additionally there is a Qt Designer plugin for the two
Okteta widgets from liboktetagui. This part is spread over the subdirs
core, gui, includes, and designer.

The Okteta elements for Kasten are specific Okteta classes for building programs and parts
with the Kasten framework. The elements are divided into the libraries liboktetakastencore,
liboktetakastengui, and liboktetakastencontroller, all found in the subdir kasten.
The basic framework Kasten itself is currently found at the subdirectory libs/kasten/.

The end-user products are the stand-alone program also named Okteta, a KPart useable
e.g. for Konqueror/KDevelop, and a module implementing the service type KHexEdit/KBytesEdit
as defined by some kdelibs interfaces. These are in the subdirs program and parts.
