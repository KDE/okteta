hex editor library
==================
part of the Okteta project (trunk/playground/utils/okteta)
Author/Maintainer: Friedrich W. H. Kossebau <kossebau@kde.org>


description:
-----------
The lib is the main work of Okteta. It offers
a general usable hex edit widget "KByteArrayView"
that interacts with an abstract data buffer
interface called "KAbstractByteArray". This interface can
be subclassed to offer access to different byte arrays
like paged gigabyte big files, video memory or whatever
you can imagine (hopefully).

For those simply needing a widget for a plain array of bytes
there is the widget subclass "KBytesEdit", which hides the
bytearray interface and publically simply interacts with
arrays (like "char Array[25];").


installing:
-----------
As these widgets and the bytearray interface have not got
much testing the API might not be finished. Because of that
it won't be made public available, i.e. there will be no headers
installed.


usage:
------
This lib is by now only used by the KBytesEdit part, to be found
in "../parts/kbytesedit".
It is _not_ used by the current KHexEdit app.
