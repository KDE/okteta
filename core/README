description:
-----------
The lib offers an abstract byte array interface called "AbstractByteArrayModel".
This interface can be subclassed to offer access to different byte arrays
like paged gigabyte big files, video memory or whatever
you can imagine (hopefully). Some example byte array models are included.


installing:
-----------
As the bytearray interface is still in active development the API is not yet finished.
Because of that no headers are installed.
