description:
-----------
libkakao is another approach to a model-view-controller oriented system
for (set of) programs operating on "desktop" objects.

It's a work in progress, there are a lot of undocumented temporary solutions
to have the basic system work at all. Do not try to guess the planned architecture
by the existing classes and their methods. There are a lot of unsketched ideas which
will be tried and developed by the time.

For other, currently more advanced (in code ;) systems look for
Sublime in kdevplatform, Kate's doc/view system, or the one used by KOffice.
Once libkakao is in a state where discussions make sense I will let the world
know.


About the name:
--------------
Guess what I was drinking when I thought that kmvt (t from toolet)
or kmvc sound boring. So far it is just the project name.
