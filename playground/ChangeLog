0.1.0 (14.05.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
------
Initial version
first coded ideas

0.1.3 (21.05.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-----
abstraction of a columns view introduced
-> to leave such general widget calculations out of the hex view
-> to make diff hex view easier

implemented close to all display settings old khexedit does offer:
* switching off offset and/or text columns
* grouping chars
* adjusting line width to widget size, optionally locking grouping of chars


0.1.4 (28.05.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-----
start of adding editor capabilities
looking at qtexteditor
-> new class KBufferCursor

0.1.5 (19.06.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-----
still fighting how to get the editor done
new class KBufferLayout: holds all the layout data
(interaction Layout <- Cursor: interesting concept for hexdiff)
cleaning of public api: only khexview.h (+ kcolumnsview.h) and kdatabuffer.h (+readonlybuffer+wrappingio)

0.1.6 (30.06.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
------
huhhh... finally we achieved visual selection interaction!!!!
but really needs some code and design cleanup at a given time
new Classes KSection, KSelection, and KBufferRanges (unclear role)

0.1.7 (03.07.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
------
coming closer to editing
new experimental KDataBuffer subclasses KPlainBuffer, KFixedSizeBuffer and KBigBuffer
moving more properties to the buffer, like modified
seems undo/redo has to go there, too

0.1.8 (14.07.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
------
still no editing but at least copy and drag, taking it as one more step
introduced KBytesEdit as a beginner's hexedit widget
new file khe.h to collect general enums and consts, will see how many there are
made colors respect the system wide settings

0.1.9 (22.07.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
------
worked at the API documentation, resulting also in more behaviour defined code
made the only KDE dependency optional: QFont("fixed") or KGlobalSettings::fixedFont()
so this widget could be used also in qt-pur apps. Hm, should we tell this to the world at some time?
added inital support for qt designer in new subdir dplugin
borked the cursor a little :-\

0.1.10 (30.07.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-------
included the kpart and the initial KHexEdit2 app in the project
included also the test app for kbytesedit "byteseditapp"
extended the support for qt designer (made more parameters accessable)

0.1.11 (01.08.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-------
new feature: "cursor behind" I hope this yields more usability
moved all files of the library into a new subdir lib
moved isWordChar to KDataBuffer, thus making KBufferCursor unaware of KDataBuffer
this makes KDataBuffer bloated (adds KSection dependency) but looks cleaner altogether
changing KDataBuffer API to use KSection (keeping old interface as easy migration)
changed all license remarks to GPL 2
renamed KHexConverter to KByteCodec

0.1.12 (15.08.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-------
converting KSection to template class KRange, as the new class KCoordRange has nearly the same features,
making KSection and KBufferRange subclasses -> less code (hoping c++ compilers don't bloat the app too
much because of this)
changing KColumns line drawing API to: paintFirstLine, paintNextLine
cleaned code and calls of KBufferColumn
added spacing in the middle to binary coding
changing Repainting to work based on KCoordRange
and finally... early editing is achieved!!!! Yeaaahh.
Okay, this will the first public release...

0.1.13 (xx.08.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-------
added a frame cursor for the inactive column
removed close to all artefacts
cleaned up selection by mouse
new signal inputFailed() to signal if a user's input (like key press) is not even partially inserted
editing in the hex column basically works

0.1.14 (xx.09.03 Friedrich W. H. Kossebau)
-------
KPixelXs and KPixelYs introduced: typedefs of KSection for pixel ranges 
now we got closer to feature completeness: editing finally is usable
