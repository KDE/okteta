Planned FEATURES
================

select whole lines by clicking on the offset column
---------------------
when the mouse cursor is above the offset column the shape turns into a mirrored pointer.
clicking onto an offset number selects the whole line. Clicking at one number, holding the button
pressed and moving to other lines selects inclusively the lines between the first and the actual
(the way it is done in some text processing apps)


work out size policy and the like
---------------------------------
MaximumSize, Minimumsize, sizehint etc. should get usefull values


paste, copy, insert, drag'n'drop using the coding
-----------------------------
when moving data in and out of the hex column use the coding


dynamic selection by mouse using double/triple click
--------------------------------------------
as already started a mouse selection following a double click selects word by word, a triple line by line


undo/redo
---------
This lacks the support in the databuffer subclasses


mark the maximum size of a buffer
---------------------------------
for buffers that have been given a maximum size there should be optionally a visual marker for the maximal size


editing the digits in the hex column
------------------------------------
Update of the char in the text column immediatly or by a timer?
allow more editing (going left/right, using delete) when clicking by mouse inside an byte edit
Escape breaks editing and returns to previous value: what todo with new inserted?


offer the possibility to edit the text in the designer
------------------------------------------------------
the default text is perhaps a little bit to whatever
also there are people who would like a larger and a smaller data set
now that we work with interfaces only think about how to offer a designer plugin


make the colorization customizable
----------------------------------
like showing strings first for more than 3-4 chars
perhaps support for syntax


implement multiple selections
-----------------------------
develop an interface along kate/ktexteditor's syntax highlighting ?
or try to expose more of that in the api ?
different types of multiple ranges, ordered in a hierarchie
treat selections and markings as superposed ranges
interface to define new range types and their draw style
draw style: background color, text color, font style (perhaps even font and size?)


KNOWN BUGS
==========
when setting new coding the resizestyle is not reflected
doing the first selection the cursor is redrawm too late (into the selection)
when deleting the screen is not always totally cleared
Wortweise nach rechts springt vom Ende ganz an den Anfang.
selection by mouse over the end does strange things to the last byte on column change
leaving editmode by tab doesn't move the cursor to the next position ...


SOLVED:
if a new appended char leads to a new line the cursor is not made visible
frame cursor disappears on font change
Ctrl+Delete on behind the last word should delete until the end
selecting the whole line doesn't copy it to the mouse buffer
dragging in overwrite mode cuts the dragged array
inserting doesn't result in the right to be repainted range (no actually?)
entering a letter on the last char of a filled buffer doesn't put the cursor behind the last char.
entering a letter at the end of an filled buffer sets the cursor from behind to on the last char, so the next key hit will overwrite this one
beim Tastaturselektieren abwärts in die letzte Zeile springt der Cusor auf das letzte, nicht hinter das letzte
backspace in overwrite mode should move the cursor one to the left instead of remove
doesn't get the right nooflinesperpage in the beginning
pos key doesn't result in a jump to the first but the last pos
