select whole lines by clicking on the offset column
---------------------
when the mouse cursor is above the offset column the shape turns into a mirrored pointer.
clicking onto an offset number selects the whole line. Clicking at one number, holding the button
pressed and moving to other lines selects inclusively the lines between the first and the actual
(the way it is done in some text processing apps)



work out size policy and the like
---------------------------------
MaximumSize, Minimumsize, sizehint etc. should get usefull values

paste, copy, insert, drag'n'drop using the coding
-----------------------------
when moving data in and out of the hex column use the coding



clean up buffercolumn painting
------------------------------
still found no pattern :(



KNOWN BUGS
----------
incorrect cursor shape on font change
when setting new coding the resizestyle is not reflected
double click borks cursor
