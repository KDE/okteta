FEATURES
========

select whole lines by clicking on the offset column
---------------------
when the mouse cursor is above the offset column the shape turns into a mirrored pointer.
clicking onto an offset number selects the whole line. Clicking at one number, holding the button
pressed and moving to other lines selects inclusively the lines between the first and the actual
(the way it is done in some text processing apps)


work out size policy and the like
---------------------------------
MaximumSize, Minimumsize, sizehint etc. should get usefull values


paste, copy, insert, drag'n'drop using the coding
-----------------------------
when moving data in and out of the hex column use the coding


dynamic selection by mouse using double/triple click
--------------------------------------------
as already started a selection following a double click selects word by word, a triple line by line


undo/redo
---------
This lacks the support in the databuffer subclasses


offering input behind the last char
-----------------------------------
if the buffer is not filled up and the actual size can be extended show the cursor bnot behind but as a full cursor

Version 1:
Simply extend the databuffer by one and cut it off before returning
-> direct access to databuffer will be inconsistent
Version 2:
tell the cursor about. As he hasn't access to the buffer itself the information about the maximum size has to be put
somewhere in cursor or layout. Perhaps it even can be handled by the hexedit giving the cursor a simple flag NewInputPos.
Drawing the cursor isn't a problem. Only navigation.


mark the maximum size of a buffer
---------------------------------
for buffers that have been given a maximum size there should be optionally a visual marker for the maximal size


editing the digits in the hex column
------------------------------------
on a key press the actual byte is marked and the old value is overwritten
an extra editing mode with inverted painting of the whole byte
gets overwritten by external settings (setCursorPosition,
when the last possible digit is inserted the cursor moves to the right
using + and - to in-/decrease the value, switches to extra edit mode as well
using backspace
Update of the char in the text column immediatly or by a timer?
allow more editing (going left/right, using delete) when clicking by mouse inside an byte edit
Escape breaks editing and returns to previous value


offer the possibility to edit the text in the designer
------------------------------------------------------
the default text is perhaps a little bit to whatever
also there are people who would like a larger and a smaller data set


paint not a frame but a still cursor in the inactive column in insert mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

punkt für alle unter 32
strings erst ab 3-4 Zeichen als solche darstellen
beim eingeben nach ganz ausgefülltem Zeichen gleich zum nächsten Byte weiter
bei magPos nicht hälfte byte sondern halbes Digit zum Ende hin.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
frame cursor disappears on font change **
when setting new coding the resizestyle is not reflected
doing the first selection the cursor is redrawm too late (into the selection)
in append mode the first char on a new line doesn't get a frame (the blinking cursor comes later, too) **
if a new appended char leads to a new line the cursor is not made visible
when deleting the screen is not always totally cleared
Wortweise nach rechts springt vom Ende ganz an den Anfang.
** maybe related

SOLVED:
Ctrl+Delete on behind the last word should delete until the end
selecting the whole line doesn't copy it to the mouse buffer
dragging in overwrite mode cuts the dragged array
inserting doesn't result in the right to be repainted range (no actually?)
entering a letter on the last char of a filled buffer doesn't put the cursor behind the last char.
entering a letter at the end of an filled buffer sets the cursor from behind to on the last char, so the next key hit will overwrite this one
beim Tastaturselektieren abwärts in die letzte Zeile springt der Cusor auf das letzte, nicht hinter das letzte
backspace in overwrite mode should move the cursor one to the left instead of remove
doesn't get the right nooflinesperpage in the beginning
pos key doesn't result in a jump to the first but the last pos
