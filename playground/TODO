FEATURES
========

select whole lines by clicking on the offset column
---------------------
when the mouse cursor is above the offset column the shape turns into a mirrored pointer.
clicking onto an offset number selects the whole line. Clicking at one number, holding the button
pressed and moving to other lines selects inclusively the lines between the first and the actual
(the way it is done in some text processing apps)


work out size policy and the like
---------------------------------
MaximumSize, Minimumsize, sizehint etc. should get usefull values


paste, copy, insert, drag'n'drop using the coding
-----------------------------
when moving data in and out of the hex column use the coding


dynamic selection by mouse using double/triple click
--------------------------------------------
as already started a selection following a double click selects word by word, a triple line by line



undo/redo
---------
This lacks the support in the databuffer subclasses


offering input behind the last char
-----------------------------------
if the buffer is not filled up and the actual size can be extended show the cursor bnot behind but as a full cursor


KNOWN BUGS
==========
incorrect cursor shape on font change
when setting new coding the resizestyle is not reflected
entering a letter at the end of an filled buffer sets the cursor from behind to on the last char, so the next key hit will overwrite this one
entering a letter on the last char of a filled buffer doesn't put the cursor behind the last char.
dragging in overwrite mode cuts the dragged array
Ctrl+Delete on behind the last word should delete until the end
beim Tastaturselektieren abwärts in die letzte Zeile springt der Cusor auf das letzte, nicht hinter das letzte
doing the first selection the cursor is redrawm too late (into the selection)
doesn't get the right nooflinesperpage in the beginning
inserting doesn't result in the right to be repainted range (no actually?)
pos key doesn't result in a jump to the first but the last pos
