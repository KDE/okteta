Test suite for the KHexEdit2 library and parts
----------------------------------------------
(see kdeutils/khexedit/{lib,parts})


* uses Tim Jansen's KDE::Test framework (found in kdenonbeta/kdeutil)

* Unsermake still misses support for the TESTS variable so you have to 
  call the test apps manually

* not tested with automake but should work as supposed
